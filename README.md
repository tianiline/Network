- <b>[Designing Network topology](https://imgur.com/a/Gwse4Nd) </b>
    - Description: Designed and implemented basic network topologies using Packet Tracer.
 Connected devices and configured basic device settings.
 Tested network connectivity by pinging devices within the network.
 Explored additional features of Packet Tracer, such as configuring interfaces and VLANs.
 Created and saved multiple network topologies for future reference.

    - Description: Successfully created a network topology with multiple routers and switches.
•	Configured IP addresses on router interfaces and enabled IP routing.
•	Implemented static routing by defining static routes between routers.
•	Configured and enabled a dynamic routing protocol such as RIP or OSPF.
•	Verified the routing table on each router and observed correct route advertisements.
•	Tested network connectivity by successfully pinging between devices in different networks.
•	Analysed the behaviour of the routing protocols and observed route changes or updates.

    - Description: In a real-world scenario using Cisco Packet Tracer, designing a network comprising routers, switches, and end devices. Created two distinct LAN networks with separate IP addressing schemes and ensure the ability to transfer packets between them.
